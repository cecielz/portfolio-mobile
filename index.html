			In an ideal world, virtual reality would be just like regular reality, 
			except without regular reality’s annoying restrictions on human flight, 
			teleportation, endless/consequence-free consumption, etc. As it is VR, 
			it is inescapably VR—you can lose yourself, but only to a point. 
			This has to do partly with the technology’s bulkiness, but also its 
			sensory limitations. Smell and taste, two fairly major components of 
			regular reality—key to memory, present-time enjoyment, and more—do not 
			factor into commercial VR equipment.

			Theme parks have been creating experiences like this with 3D glasses, hydraulic seats, and machines for blowing air, spraying water, and emitting scent. But an interactive, multi-sensory VR experience like this feels about as far-fetched as VR felt in the ‘80s. Of course, this seems possible with high resolution direct brain stimulation and much greater computational power, but this technology is at least decades away. Meanwhile, there are technologies that can help us achieve part of this. Sound is the most integrated, with every VR system including some means of approximating 3D sound. Sound fidelity still lags significantly behind the visual experience, but it’s easy to produce and essential for immersion, so for the most part we can consider that covered. For smell, there are products and research based on liquid scent cartridges that are rapidly vaporized and mixed for immersive olfactory experiences. There has also been preliminary work in direct electrical stimulation of smell receptors. Given that taste centers around regionally distributed receptors on the tongue, most research has focussed on direct electrical and thermal stimulation.
