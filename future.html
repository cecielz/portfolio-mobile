			No matter what sensory technologies may be added to our devices, the first imperative for XR device makers is still the visual aspect of the user experience. XR headsets deliver immersive experiences thanks to significant and ongoing hardware and software development on the part of designers and manufacturers. In the R&D lab and in production, these devices demand rigorous testing and quality assurance to achieve the intended user experience.

			Poorly designed headsets can deliver poor quality images and even cause issues like motion sickness if image alignment, clarity, and responsiveness are not perfectly coordinated. Display images must also be defect-free at high resolution. Because they are viewed so close to the eye, the tiniest blemish or irregularity in an XR display becomes glaringly obvious, detracting from the user experience.
