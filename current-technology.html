			A rather silly way for people to feel in virtual reality - the idea was that a little robot would follow you around with a little table on top and then you would touch the table in order to feel objects. This is hardly the sort of touch needed in order for us to realize some of our “fantasies” in VR. Then, we came across an interesting company called Ultrahaptics that’s using ultrasound to make touch happen with the almost $40 million they’ve raised so far.

			There’s no denying that those clunky VR headsets we use today aren’t going to work if we want to emulate “real reality”. For full visual immersion we’ve floated the idea before of “smart contact lenses”. Some of our readers who work on these things for a living said this wasn’t possible, though the results appear to be still inconclusive. The only other thing we could think of was inserting some sort of needle into the back of our necks such that we can tie right into the brain stem and start feeding it stuff. If that happens, then we can digitize the entire experience along with every single sense. It would be the equivalent of being in a dream except everything would be as vivid and real as it is today. There would be some sort of “safe word type” mechanism you could use to exit. You could go into settings and adjust a series of sliders like “pain” or “depression” which default to “off” but exist so that all you sadomasochists out there can still get your rocks off.
